# What is AO Challenger?

AO Challenger is an Arcane Odyssey Discord bot that allows you to **ping globally for PvP or find a 1v1**. [ALL of the code is fully free and open source](https://github.com/ciabidev/AO-Challenger).

## How to Use

### For Users

\`/findpvp\` — join the queue for a 1v1  
\`/globalpvp ping\` — ping an entire region for PvP

### For Admins

To setup the bot for your server, simply use \`/globalpvp setup\`  
\`/globalpvp setup\` — setup the bot  
\`/globalpvp settings\` — manage the globalpvp settings  
\`/globalpvp muteuser\` — block a user from pinging your server  
\`/globalpvp unmuteuser\` — unblock a user from pinging your server  
\`/globalpvp setchannel\` — set the channel where global PvP pings will be sent  
\`/globalpvp setregionalroles\` — assign roles to regions to be pinged

## Terms and Privacy

We do not store any data about you or your pings. Your data is your business and your business only (this is the statement on all of our projects).  
We are not responsible for rules broken using this bot.  
This bot is not affiliated with Arcane Odyssey or any of its subsidiaries.

## Why can't I add the bot / Why is it so slow?

Two possible reasons:
1. I accidentally made it private  
2. For the bot to scale larger and be in more servers, I need to verify my identity. Unfortunately, I'm not old enough to verify my identity on Discord (18+)
