## Support the bot

## Why can't I add the bot / Why is it so slow?

Four possible reasons:
1. I accidentally made it private  
2. For the bot to scale larger and be in more servers, I need to verify my identity. Unfortunately, I'm not old enough to verify my identity on Discord (18+)
3. The Render free plan for the bot has expired
4. The bot is being rate-limited. This means someone is spamming the bot, or there's just a lot of activity.

In case any of these have happened, message @wheatwhole_ on Discord IMMEDIATELY.
