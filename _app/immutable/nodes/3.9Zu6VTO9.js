## Terms and Privacy

We do not store any data about you or your pings. Your data is your business and your business only (this is the statement on all of our projects).  
We are not responsible for rules broken using this bot.  
This bot is not affiliated with Arcane Odyssey or any of its subsidiaries.

## Why can't I add the bot / Why is it so slow?

Two possible reasons:
1. I accidentally made it private  
2. For the bot to scale larger and be in more servers, I need to verify my identity. Unfortunately, I'm not old enough to verify my identity on Discord (18+)
