## Why can't I add the bot / Why is it so slow?

Two possible reasons:
1. I accidentally made it private  
2. For the bot to scale larger and be in more servers, I need to verify my identity. Unfortunately, I'm not old enough to verify my identity on Discord (18+)
3. The Render free plan for the bot has expired

In case any of these have happened, message @wheatwhole_ on Discord IMMEDIATELY.
