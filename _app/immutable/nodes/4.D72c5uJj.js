## what is lumi
made by wheatwhole

lumi is a simple discord bot that allows servers to track the online/offline status of roblox players. it cannot track the specific game a roblox player is playing, and renown and clan for each player must be set manually
Lumi is currently private since I made it for a clan, though it's fully ready for public use if needed

## terms and privacy
lumi completely complies with roblox TOS. lumi uses Roblox's public APIs to fetch user data, and does not store any personal information about users. lumi is not affiliated with Roblox in any way.
lumi is not responsible for any actions taken by it's users

### for Arcane Odyssey Staff
Please contact me if you have any issues with the bot/want it taken down
### why lumi is 100% allowed for Arcane Odyssey clans
